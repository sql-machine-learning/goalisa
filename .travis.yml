install:
  # Note(tony): TravisCI's native `go get ${gobuild_args} ./...` failed with
  # `/usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Bad value`, the cause is the system linker
  # being not up to date: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15038
  # So I decided to skip install, and go get inside sqlflow:latest image
  # Ref build: https://travis-ci.com/sql-machine-learning/sqlflow/builds/107870583

script:
  - pip install pre-commit && pre-commit run -a
  - go build ./...
  - echo "skip go test since alisa server is not available in public network"
